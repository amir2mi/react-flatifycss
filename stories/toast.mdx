# Toast

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  To notify users and communicate, you need something look-alike toasts that
  come on top of each other and will get hidden after an amount of time.
</p>

## Default

To show/hide the toast, change the `show` prop value for `<Toast />` component.

Toasts need wrapper to be appended to, so before using them add the **`<ToastsWrapper />`** somewhere in your app, **it should be added once**.

## Icon

Use the `<ToastIcon />` component inside `<Toast />`, its content would be a svg.

## Close button

To enable the close button for a toast, add the `closeButton` to `<Toast />` component.  
Close button do not close the toast, however emit the `onClose` event.  
Note that close button does not have any text inside, so you should set a label with `closeButtonLabel` prop, that will be used by screen readers.
