# Input

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  With a single component, you can create many different types of input.
</p>
<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Default

By structure the `input` HTML element will be in a wrapper, so `className` will be applied to `input`. To add class names to the wrapper, use `wrapperClassName` prop for `<Input />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--default" />
</Canvas>

## Floating label

The label can be inside the input, just add the `hasFloatingLabel={true}` to `<Input />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--floating-label" />
</Canvas>

## Number

Change the input type with `type` prop. For example, input with type `number` supports `min`, `max`, `step` and other related props.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--number" />
</Canvas>

## Range

Like input with the type of number, range also supports the props mentioned above.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--range" />
</Canvas>

## Password

Just set the `type` to `password`, you can use `togglePassword` prop to show the eye button to toggle the password visibility.  
**Note that the password toggle button should have a valid label**, so set the `togglePasswordLabel="Show/Hide password"` to your `<Input />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--password" />
</Canvas>

## Search bar

Add a button as children with specified class names and wrapper class names to have a search bar.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--search-bar" />
</Canvas>

## States

An `<Input />` component supports these four states with unique style, `default`, `valid`, `warning` and `invalid`.

To hide the states icon, set the `stateIcon` to `false`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--states" />
</Canvas>

### A basic validation example

Here's a simple validation example: based on user input, we change the `state‚Å£` and the helper message.  
Also in this example, we've changed the default states color with `colorInvalid="#EC87C0"`, `colorValid="#A0CECB"` and `colorWarning="#8067B7"` props.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--validation" />
</Canvas>

## Uncontrolled

By default, if you do not set the `value` prop, the input value will be saved internally and you can get it from `onChange`, `onFocus` and `onBlur` everytime it is changed. To control the value yourself just set the `value` prop and get the value on change and update it yourself with your state.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-input--uncontrolled" />
</Canvas>
