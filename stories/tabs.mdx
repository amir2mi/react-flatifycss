# Tabs

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  With Tabs we can have different layers of content in the same place and users
  can choose which layer they want to see.
</p>
<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Default

Created tabs by separating tabs and its content.  
For tabs use `<TabList />` with `<Tab />`s inside.  
For contents use `<TabPanels />` with `<TabPanel />`s inside.

### Default tab

You can change the default tab to be displayed, set the `defaultIndex` to `<Tabs />` component.

  <Story id="components-tabs--default" />
</Canvas>

## Top line

Tab line can be placed to top instead of bottom, set the `linePosition="top"` for `<TabList />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-tabs--top-line" />
</Canvas>

## Centered

Add the `centered` to `<TabList />`, so tabs will be center aligned.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-tabs--centered" />
</Canvas>

## Bordered

To have borders around the tabs component, add the `bordered` prop to `<Tabs />`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-tabs--bordered" />
</Canvas>

## Scrollable

By default if tabs overflow, they go to the next line but sometimes you might not need that behavior, so add the `scrollable={true}` to `<TabList />` and it will be scrolled horizontally if that's necessary.

## Animation

Change the animation by setting the `animation` prop to `<TabPanels />` component, possible values are: `default`, `fade` and `none`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-tabs--animation" />
</Canvas>

### Custom animation

It is possible to use your custom animation to show tabs, set the `showAnimation` to `<TabPanels />`, the expected value is a css animation like this: `tab-custom-show-anim ease 0.3s`.

## Other features

Tabs component is created with [Reach UI tabs component](https://reach.tech/tabs#tabs-keyboardactivation), so these options are available:

### keyboardActivation

Describes the activation mode when navigating a tablist with a keyboard. When set to "auto", a tab panel is activated automatically when a tab is highlighted using **arrow keys**. When set to "manual", the user must activate the tab panel with either the **Spacebar** or **Enter** keys.  
Defaults to "auto".

### index

Tab's state can be controlled by the owner. Make sure to include an onChange as well, or else the tabs will not be interactive.
