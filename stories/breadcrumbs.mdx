# Breadcrumbs

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  Breadcrumbs are a necessary part of any website, they determine where users
  are so they can navigate.

<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Default

Always set the `⁣label` prop for `<Breadcrumbs />⁣` component. It is used by screen readers to tell users about your breadcrumbs. For example, your page might have more than one breadcrumb, so be sure to describe them differently and improve your website's accessibility.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-breadcrumbs--default" />
</Canvas>

## Fit content

To limit breadcrumbs wrapper width to available content width, set the `fitContent` to `true` for `<Breadcrumbs />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-breadcrumbs--fit-content" />
</Canvas>

## Scrollable

By default, if breadcrumbs overflow, it will be scrollable.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-breadcrumbs--scrollable" />
</Canvas>

## Scroll to the end

Following UX best practices, it is suggested to set the scroll to the end of breadcrumbs by default, so users will know where they are in the first place and then decide where they want to go.

However, it is not done by default, you can set the `scrollTo` to `left` or `right` for `<Breadcrumbs />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-breadcrumbs--scroll-to-end" />
</Canvas>
