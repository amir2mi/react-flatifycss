# Modal

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  Modal, pop-up box, bottom sheet, off-canvas, anything can be related to this
  component, we generally call it modal. There are different types of modals
  with different sizes and styles that come with FlatifyCSS, which we will cover
  with practical examples on this page.
</p>
<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Default

To hide and display the modal use `isOpen` prop for the `<Modal />` component, also you can listen to change this prop to hide the modal with `onDismiss` prop, like this `onDismiss={() => setIsOpen(false)}`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--default" />
</Canvas>

### Modal parts

Each modal can have `<ModalHeader />`, `<ModalBody />` and `<ModalFooter />` components inside as children.

<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Disable overlay click

By default if the user clicks on modal overlay, the modal will be dismissed.  
However sometimes the action is required and it should be dismissed only after an action, to do so you can set the `disableOverlayClick={false}` for `<Modal />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--disabled-overlay-click" />
</Canvas>

## Bordered

In this case, the header and footer will have borders to get separated visually from body.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--bordered" />
</Canvas>

## Positioned

Modals can be opened from top, bottom, right and left sides, just set the `position` for `<Modal />` component. Each side will have its special animation.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--positioned" />
</Canvas>

## Custom overlay

With `overlayClassName` prop, it is possible to pass a custom class to modal overlay, so to style it.  
Note that **passed class styles should be global**. For example, styles with `sx` prop will not work, because the overlay itself is appended to the body not inside the modal.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--custom-overlay" />
</Canvas>
