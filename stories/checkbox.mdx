# Checkbox

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  You can have customized checkboxes, it is done with pure CSS which has a clean
  design and is keyboard friendly, also easy to have one.

<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Default

To have a **controlled** checkbox (that you control the checked state yourself), add the `checked` prop.  
To toggle, you can use the second argument of `onChange` event like so, `onChange={(e, checked) => setChecked(checked)}`

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-checkbox--default" />
</Canvas>

## Uncontrolled

You can have an uncontrolled checkbox as well, just do not use the `checked` prop and get the checked state with `onChange(event, isChecked)` argument.


<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-checkbox--uncontrolled" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-checkbox--disabled" />
</Canvas>

## States

All form elements have `valid`, `warning` and `invalid` states, you can determine with `state` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-checkbox--states" />
</Canvas>

## Customized

Let's customize states of the checkbox styles with `colorInvalid`, `colorValid` and `colorWarning` props.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-checkbox--customized" />
</Canvas>
