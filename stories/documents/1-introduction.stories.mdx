FlatifyCSS has a playful design and gives you features to help you develop your project quickly and easily:

- <mark class="inline style-blue-light">Customizability</mark>

  With the power of CSS custom properties, it is possible to customize colors, typography, animations, etc. You can do the customization for each component or generally from the config file. For example, here is a default button and we want to create a new kind of button:

  <div class="funky-spacer-sm" />

- <mark class="inline style-green-light">Accessibility</mark>

  It is keyboard-friendly, the friend of assistive technologies, and supports the reduced motion for animation and transitions when the user prefers.

  <div class="funky-spacer-sm" />

- <mark class="inline style-orange-light">
    Support for right to left layouts{' '}
  </mark>

  FlatifyCSS comes with files prefixed as -rtl.css built especially for the right to left languages like Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, etc. You can also extend the right to left styles by using the flatify-rtl.scss file and conditional statements.

  <div class="funky-spacer-sm" />

- <mark class="inline style-purple-light">Practical set of components</mark>

  There are more than twenty components that can be mixed and make more complex user interfaces, each component has its unique CSS variables and can be customized based on the usage.

- <mark class="inline style-pink-light">Based on Styled Components</mark>

  The components are created based on styled-components, so you can add your styles and get benefits of using styled components with joy.
