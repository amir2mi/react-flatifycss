# Radio

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  Radios are used when there are multiple options, but the limit is one, users
  can choose to have one of them.
</p>
<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Default

To have a **controlled** radio (that you control the checked state yourself), add the `checked` prop.  
To toggle, you can use the second argument of `onChange` event like so, `onChange={(e, checked) => setChecked(!checked)}`

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-radio--default" />
</Canvas>

## Uncontrolled

You can specify the radio default value with `defaultChecked` prop, then toggle by using the `onChange` second argument.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-radio--uncontrolled" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple

When you want to choose one option from available options, you can use `value` with `checked` props.  
Here is how, each radio has its specific `name`, a `value` that is set to active radio `name` and `onChange` event third argument, which represents the selected radio `name` like so:
`onChange={(e, checked, value) => setChecked(value)}`

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-radio--multiple" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-radio--disabled" />
</Canvas>

## States

All form elements have `valid`, `warning` and `invalid` states, you can determine with `state` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-radio--states" />
</Canvas>

## Customized

Let's customize states of the radio styles with `colorInvalid`, `colorValid` and `colorWarning` props.
