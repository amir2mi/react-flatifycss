# Accordion

<p class="component-doc-intro">
  Accordions are vertically collapsible components that contain content inside,
  they come in handy for a lot of situations as an example the list of FAQ or
  small screen devices submenus.
</p>
<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Default

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--default" />
</Canvas>

## Icon

To have a reactive plus/minus icon add `hasIcon={true}` to the `<AccordionButton />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--icon" />
</Canvas>

## Bordered

Accordion supports bordered styles by adding `bordered` prop to the `<Accordion />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--bordered" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple

It is also possible to have multiple accordion items that can be open, just by adding both `multiple` and `collapsible` props to the `<Accordion />` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--bordered" />
</Canvas>

## Animation

By default accordion has two animations ready to use. To change the animation set the `animation` prop which accepts `default`, `fade` and a custom animation string like this: `0.5s ease-in-out flatify-slide-down-in`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--fade-animation" />
</Canvas>

### Animation Duration

Change the animation duration with `duration` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--duration" />
</Canvas>

## Default open item

You can specify which accordion item should be opened by default, just set the `defaultIndex` for the `<Accordion />` component.

<div class="funky-spacer" />

## ReadOnly

By adding the `readOnly` prop to the `<Accordion />` component it will not open or close any accordion item on click.

<div class="funky-spacer" />

## Customization

Here we gave each `<AccordionItem />` component a different `theme` prop, by the way created and set a brand new animation with the `animation` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--customized" />
</Canvas>

## Other features

Accordion component is created with [Reach UI Accordion component](https://reach.tech/accordion#accordion-index), so these options are available:

### defaultIndex

A default value for the open panel's index or indices in an uncontrolled accordion component when it is initially rendered.

### index

The index or array of indices for open accordion panels. The index prop should be used along with `onChange` to create controlled accordion components.
